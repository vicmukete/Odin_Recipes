            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Remove steak from refrigerator and let it come to room
        temperature for 30 minutes. Rub steak with 1 tablespoon of vegetable
        oil and season all over with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper,
        and 3/4 teaspoon paprika. Hea  a medium bast iron skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until a deep golden crust begins to form
        on both sides of the steak, about 5 minutes total. Reduce heat to medium-low
        and add butter to pan. Using a kitchen towel, carefully grip the skillet handle
        and tilt towards you so that the melting butter forms a pool at the bottom
        of the skillet. Using a meat thermometer, check for doneness: 120-125F for medium rare
        Transfer steak onto a cutting board and let rest for about 10 minutes.
        Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering.
        Crack egg into pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until white is set and edges
        are just beginning to brown. Remove from pan and season with salt and pepper. Slice
        steak into 1 inch strips on a bias and against the grain. Serve steak with eggs and potatoes.
        Garnish with herbs and season with more salt and pepper to taste.</p>
